## What is this?

This repository serves as a way to help me setup (from a clean install) and maintain my Mac. It automates much of the installation process, including application install and the setting up of preferences. 




## Installation

Run the following in Terminal.app to clone this repo. This can be run from any path. The repo is stored in a newly created 'src' directory, located at ~/src. All Github repos are stored here, with the exception of application extensions (i.e. Glyphs scripts and plugins).

mkdir -p $src && cd $src && git clone https://github.com/RobertPratley/Dotfiles.git
